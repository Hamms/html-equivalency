Before you do that, though, let's investigate how to style a multi-page website.\n\nAs already mentioned, from this point forward we will be using external style sheets instead of styling inside the HTML file because this keeps all the styling for the website in one place.  However, in order to do this you are going to have to pay extra close attention as you remove your old styling. Even though you want consistent style on your website, you will have exceptions to the style rules in certain cases. Exceptions to the style rules might include the note card styling, which you worked on in the last lesson. We would not want every list to have the note card styling, just those specific ones on the recipe page.\n\nYou will never want to have duplicate rules for the same selector. So there should not be two stylings with `p` as the selector. Instead you need to leverage the ability to make classes in order to have multiple styles for `<p>` elements. \n\nTo practice this, we have a website with an external style sheet that also still has styling. You will need to figure out how to keep the unique elements of the individual web pages while getting a more consistent style across the pages.\n\nUnique Elements You Want to Keep:\n\n\t1.\tThe styling of the `<img>` elements on one page should be different than the other\n\t2.\tFor the `<h1>` headers, on one page we want to style them and on the other we don't.\n￼\n# Do This\n\n* Put the image on the home page in the \"home-image\" class\n* Find the old style rule for images on the home page (width: 600px) and change the selector so it will style the \"home-image\" class instead\n* Put all the images on the technology page in the \"tech-images\" class\n* Find the old style rule for images on the technology page (width: 100px) and change the selector so it will style the \"tech-images\" class instead\n* Find the h1 element on the technology page and put it in the class \"page-header\"\n* Change the secltor for the style rule for h1 elements to be just a style rule for the page-header class\n* Copy the three new style rules you created into your style.css file.\n* Delete the `<style>` element and its contents from both pages.",

However, you might be getting a sinking feeling that this could become a lot of nested `if` statements very quickly! \n\n**Instead let's use the AND operator (`&&`) to check for a genre and a rating at the same time.** \n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/a9307ead3b147e0a8016f2054f47f5f2-image-1446153610104.png\" style=\"width: 200px; float:right\">\n\nBe careful about the order of the `if` statements.

Having a more general `if` statement checked first might cut off or prevent more specific conditions from being reached.\n\nYou still want your app to give suggestions when just a rating or just a genre is detected, so keep this principle of ordering in mind.

Since this value can change, you will often see a written description for the command that looks something like **`moveForward(pixels)`** to indicate that the value supplied to `moveForward()`'s **parameter** should be the number of pixels you want it move.\n\nThe good old `moveForward()` command still exists.  In fact it's the **same command** as `moveForward(pixels)`. The \"parameter-less\" version of `moveForward()` simply supplies a **default value** to the parameter.

The \"alpha channel\" for color lets you set the level of **opacity** as a decimal value between 0 and 1. It is interpreted as a percentage, so 0.5 equates to 50% opaque.  For example: `penRGB(113, 102, 160, 0.5)`.\n\nSo far, we've always moved the turtle with the pen tracing the path. In the original robotic turtle used 50 years ago, this meant that the pen was down so that it would draw on the paper. The turtle can also move with the pen up, or not tracing its path.

As you get more experience  programming, comments you write can be in addition to, or simply replace your subgoal comments.\n\n<details><summary ><b>More: Why write comments?</b></summary>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e9f7f7; margin-left: 20px; padding: 10px\">\n<p>\nWhen sharing code with others, comments are useful to point out sections of code you might want help with, or to explain a complicated section of code that's hard to reason about.  It's useful for example to write a comment like: <code>//This function assumes that the fish have already been drawn</code> because it helps the reader understand when, where, why that section of code might be executed.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhen writing comments for yourself, it might be a note about how you plan to solve a problem, or jotting down the reason you did something to remind yourself later when you come back to it.  For example you might write a comment like: <code>//to do: make a function to handle this code below</code>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  Many programmers, when starting from scratch, like to write out a high level plan for the code they want to write in comments, and then go in starting writing code to fill in the plan. This is particularly useful if you're facing a large problem that needs to be broken down into parts.  You can think about the big picture to start and write out a strategy in comments so you don't forget it later -- which happens -- because once you start writing code you'll run into lots of micro-hurdles that might take time to solve or work out the bugs and you need your brain space to work on those.  A plan for drawing an under the sea scene might look like this:\n<pre>\n    // setup for drawing\n    // draw background with color and bubbles\n    // draw all the fish\n    // draw all the seagrass\n    // draw bubbles again\n </pre>\n</p>\n</div>\n</details>\n\n# Do This\n\n**Add your own comments** to the code that you've been working on.

So |10| is the absolute value of ten and |-10| is the absolute value of negative ten. Both evaluate to 10.\n\nIn Javascript we use `Math.abs` instead of | |.  `Math.abs(-10)` and `Math.abs(10)` both evaluate to <strong>10</strong>.\n</details> <br>\n\n# Do This:\n\n* **Write a function like the one above** that accepts two parameters (one each for `movementX` and `movementY`) and returns a radius. A higher speed should lead to a smaller radius.\n* **Inside your `mousemove` event handler,** set the radius of the circle to the value returned by your function, where the function takes `event.movementX` and `event.movementY` as input.

For example you might say \"keep going down the road until you see the gas station\" or \"keep calling until you get through to someone.\" You might think of these as \"until loops\" rather than \"while loops,\" since we want the loop to continue **until a condition is true rather than while a condition is true**.\n\n**There is no \"until loop\" in JavaScript** but it is actually quite easy to translate \"until loops\" into `while` loops so that you can use them in programs. An \"until loop\" runs *until* a condition is true, as opposed to a while loop which runs *as long as* a condition is true.  That means an until loop is the logical inverse of a while loop - it runs as long as the **condition is false**. The table below shows how you can use the **NOT** ( `!` ) operator to translate stopping conditions into `while` loop conditions.\n\n| Expressed as Stopping | Expressed as Until Loop | Expressed as While Loop |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Stop** once you reach the gas station | Keep going **until** you reach the gas station | Keep going **while** you have **NOT** reached the gas station|\n| **Stop** calling when you get through to someone | Keep calling **until** you get through to someone | Keep calling **while** you have **NOT** gotten through to someone|\n| **Stop** when `x == y` | `until(x == y){...` | `while(!(x == y)){...`|\n<br>\nNote how we can use the **NOT** operation to find the **logical inverse** (or opposite) of the condition from our \"until loop\" to create a `while` loop.

Once your computer sends a request to your database it needs to wait for the response to be sent across the Internet. \n\n**Let's have a look at just how much slower the data commands are**.\n\n\n\n**The array of objects is passed back as the parameter of the callback function for `readRecords`. ** A callback function is required for readRecords just like createRecord as the request out to the database for records will take varying amounts of time and it is necessary to have a way to notify the program once all the records have been collected and return. \n\nRemember that because of scope function **parameters are only accessible inside their function.** Thus we must **use the records from inside the readRecords callback function.**  This is also good programming practice as the asyncronous nature of fetching data from remote locations requires that we **wait for the callback function to be called to know that we have recieved all the information from the data table.**\n\n# Do This\n\n**A set of data has been provided** in a table named 'myTable'\n\n* **Open the Data Viewer** to look at the table in 'myTable'\n* **Add a `readRecords` command** to your app.\n* **Add a `console.log`** inside the callback function of `readRecords` to **print the `records`**\n* Run the program. Notice that the same information from the table is printed in the console.\n\n![](https://images.code.org/fe3db85465b5dd8a983ba5615f4e851d-image-1449504949223.gif)",

For example, if you have many buttons in your program, you will want to give each an ID that describes what the button does. For example \"forwardButton\", \"leftButton\", etc.\n\n**IDs are also case-sensitive** which means you'll want to develop a style for capitalizing IDs. A common strategy is to use a style called **camelcase**.  In camelcase style, words are combined together with no spaces and each new word, after the first, is capitalized. itTypicallyLooksLikeThis.  \n\n**Why?** Many computer systems do not allow keywords like function names and IDs to contain spaces.  You've already seen several examples like this: `moveForward`, `onEvent`, `turnLeft`, etc.  It's important to realize that camelcase is a style convention, not a hard and fast rule. Sometimes you'll see other styles such as using underscores: `move_forward`, `turn_left`.  But in App Lab we typically use camelcase.\n\n# Rules About IDs\nIn making descriptive and meaningful IDs there **are some rules about IDs** you need to know.

But what if you wanted to do something like **add 10 to the *current* value of a variable**? \n\nBecause updating the value in a variable is just moving memory around, the process has to go something like this:\n* Read the current value of a variable.\n* Add 10 to it.\n* Store the new value back into the same variable.\n\nThe technical term for this is called **variable re-assignment** - when you change the value of a variable based on its current contents.   To increase the value of `num1` by 10 you actually need to do this:\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/c49b1a0fb81de4b90558fdb278e40987-image-1445942169121.png\" style=\"float:right\">\n```\nnum1 = num1 + 10;\n```\nThe diagram at right shows a picture of what's happening (it assumes the value of `num1` is 7 before the line is executed).

This tells the computer to add 10 to whatever the value of `num1` is.  And the computer will do that, and the result will go....nowhere.  It will be lost.\n</p><p>\nBecause you are trying assign a new value to a variable it should make sense that **the = sign must be involved somehow**.  \n</p>\n<h3>\nMistake 2\n</h3>\n<p>\nIf you were in math class this statment would make no sense:\n```\nnum1 = num1 + 10;\n```\n</p><p>\nBut **remember to read = as \"gets.\"** If you read the statement above as: \"num1 *gets* the value of num1's current value plus 10\" it might make more sense.

        "U3L14 - concatenate simple_markdown_instruction": "# Text and Variables Living Together!\n\nSometimes it’s useful to display text along with the value of a variable in the same line of output. To do this you use `+` to attach a variable onto a literal string of characters.  Here is an example:\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/a35e68b062fc814871a8323938cf3384-image-1445888147995.png\" style=\"border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;\">\n\nNotice that the `+` operator has **two different meanings in JavaScript depending on what type of data you're applying it to**. Click the explanations below for more details.\n\n<details>\n<summary>If **both operands are numbers** `+` means to add those two numbers together.</summary>\n\nThis is standard addition.  It works both with numbers and with variables that contain numbers, as shown below.<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/eb50a1fcea459fe74774d903b07a274f-image-1445887814602.png\" style=\"border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;\"><br>\n\nBecause `num1` is a variable that holds a number, and 10 itself is obviously a number, in this case `+` will do addition like you would expect.\n\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>If **either of the operands is a string** `+` treats both as if they were strings and combines them to create a single string.</summary>\nThis is potentially confusing behavior and can get pretty weird if the text *looks* like numbers.  For example, this code will display **16100** to the screen.<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/a9c54b664bd192aa5bf611808d88a3bc-image-1445887893598.png\" style=\"border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;\"><br>\n\nWhy? Because JavaScript sees you trying to display a mix of text and variable values. \"16\" (in quotes) is a string of ASCII characters not a number.  And so JavaScript converts everything to text, and the characters in the result of \"16\"+\"100\" comes out to \"16100\". \n\n</details>\n<br>\n \n**TIP:** It's common to want to sandwich a variable between some text when displaying it.  You can string together multiple pieces of text and variables using the `+` operator.  For example, you can do this:\n<br> \n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/65b0e277f058903bd3b956cc59ee5253-image-1445887976271.png\" style=\"border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;\"><br>\n \n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>**Misconception Alert**</summary>\n\nThe **key thing to understand** about the `+` symbol is that it can _only_ do actual arithmetic addition if the values on either side of the `+` are actually numbers or variables that contain numbers. \n\n**And** if the `+` symbol cannot determine whether the value is a number then it **assumes it's a string**, and converts everything to a string and tries to concatenate it.  \n \nThe computer relies on you - the programmer - to make sure that the **type of data** stored in a variable is appropriate for the task at hand.\n</details><br>\n\nOn the next screen we'll have you play with this a little bit, but you'll write statements to display a mix of text and strings from here on out.\n\n# Do This:\nWe have given you the starting code shown below.

In fact in the case of the last level the program thinks you want another variable names foo. This is the result of **scope**. \n\nThere are two types of variables:\n\n1. **Gloabl Variables** - Created outside of all functions and can be seen and updated by any code.\n1. **Local Variables** - Create inside of a function and can't be seen by any other code. They get created when the function is run, and they get destroyed (seriously) when last line of code in the function has executed. If the function gets run again, then the variable is created again.\n\nSo if you say `var` in front of a variable with the same name as a global variable it actually thinks you want another variable named foo just for this function!\n\n\n# Incrementing with buttons\n\nCheck it out.

Contrast is the state of being strikingly different from something else. Check out the below example of contrasting colors.\n\n| Example 1 | Example 2 |\n| --------- | --------- |\n|<img src=\"https://images.code.org/f4f8acab4c8fe45cddef0436c52084cf-image-1476231852248.jpg\" style=\"width:200px\"> | <img src=\"https://images.code.org/76ea7aba97b7a9717f8b784b0987a055-image-1476231855350.jpg\" style=\"width:200px\"> |\n\nStare at example 1 for a few seconds. You might notice that the edges of the text blur with the background or it feels like the image is pulsing. This is because the value of the colors is too close together. The second is definitely easier to look at because one color is dark and one is light.\n\nA way to test this is convert everything to grayscale. Notice how in the example below the example with contrasting colors is easier to view in grayscale.\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/40be05f66945d5cf0fda69be95986a4a-image-1476232151166.jpg\" style=\"width:300px\">\n\nContrast can be a powerful tool to use in your website.

Over time, they will see that different types of text require different approaches to compression. The lesson ends with an activity where students develop a heuristic, or a rule of thumb, that can be applied to different pieces of text in order to compress them. \n\nThere are three Essential Knowledge Statements and one Exclusion Statement in the Framework dealing with Heuristics: \n\n>- 4.2.1D Some problems can be solved but not in a reasonable time. In these cases, heuristic approaches may be helpful to find solutions in reasonable time. \n- 4.2.2A A heuristic is a technique that may allow us to find an approximate solution when typical methods fail to find an exact solution. \n- 4.2.2B Heuristics may be helpful for finding an approximate solution more quickly when exact methods are too slow. \n- Exclusion Statement (4.2.2B): Specific heuristic solutions are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.\n\nMany people are confused by the difference between *algorithms* and *heuristics*.

If you haven’t already reviewed the materials, do that now and come back to this task later.**\n\n# Teaching and Student Support Plan\n\n## Task Description\n\nNow that you have a better sense of this lessons in this sequence, let’s think about the types of supports students will need in order to be successful. Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should cover the following: \n\n\n- **Which lesson in the sequence are you discussing?** \n\n- **Details on how you will implement and differentiate the lesson:**\n\n  - An outline of any changes you will need to make to the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \n  - An overview of the types of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example: students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more; etc)\n  - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students who already know something about the topic)\n  - How will you address or emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \n\n<br>\n- **Plan for catching up absent students:**\n\n  - How will absent students catch up on activities they missed? \n  - How will you use the fact that the lessons in this sequence are related and build on one another to address make-up work? \n\nYou can type out your teaching and student support plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \n\n## Getting Credit for Completing this Task\n\n#### Task Review Details\n\nIf this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how the lesson will play out in your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \n\nIn order to get credit for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \n\n<br><br>",
