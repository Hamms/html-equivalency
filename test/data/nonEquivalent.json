To make each list item, use the list item tags `<li> </li>` and write the list item inside the tags.\n<br /><br/>\nIt can be helpful to indent your `<li> </li>` tags so it's clear they are contained in the `<ol> </ol>` tags.\n</details>\n</div>\n\nYou can also use HTML to make different types of lists on your web page.  This recipe includes two different types of lists, one ordered (with numbers) and one unordered (with bullets).\n\n#  Do This\n\n* Use the inspector tool to see the code that is making the two different kinds of lists.\n* Make sure you and your partner agree on what the different tags do.\n* Fix the code so that the second item in each list displays correctly",

To guarantee the best results for displaying your web page on all computers you need to assist the computer in figuring out where to find information. <br> <br>\n\nAs you go forward you are going to need two different sections in your HTML file. They will serve different purposes.\n<br><br>\n1. Content of the page<br>\n2. Information about the page<br>\n<br>\nBy breaking up a web page this way it is clear where to find the code that is creating the physical output on the web page and which code is just information for the computer about the page.<br><br>\n\nIn creating web pages we differentiate between these two areas using the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. The &lt;head&gt; element contains all the information about the page.  The &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content for a web page.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**What is a head element?**</summary>\nThe &lt;head&gt; element contains all the information about the page. This is extra information that is helpful for the computer in displaying your web page but is not the physical content of the web page. \n\nThe &lt;head&gt; element usually comes above the body element but inside the &lt;html&gt; element. For right now it will be blank but later we will learn important things that are added to the head.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**How is the head element different than the header elements? **</summary>\nThe header elements (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) are used to display headers directly on your web page for your user to see. The head tag marks the information that is not user facing in your HTML document. \n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**What is the body element? **</summary>\n\n The &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content for a web page.

Before you do that, though, let's investigate how to style a multi-page website.\n\nAs already mentioned, from this point forward we will be using external style sheets instead of styling inside the HTML file because this keeps all the styling for the website in one place.  However, in order to do this you are going to have to pay extra close attention as you remove your old styling. Even though you want consistent style on your website, you will have exceptions to the style rules in certain cases. Exceptions to the style rules might include the note card styling, which you worked on in the last lesson. We would not want every list to have the note card styling, just those specific ones on the recipe page.\n\nYou will never want to have duplicate rules for the same selector. So there should not be two stylings with `p` as the selector. Instead you need to leverage the ability to make classes in order to have multiple styles for `<p>` elements. \n\nTo practice this, we have a website with an external style sheet that also still has styling.

To start let's take a closer look at the `onEvent` block. We already know that event handlers call a function. What we'll see now is that they also **pass a parameter**. The default name for this parameter is simply `event` but you can change it to be anything you like. \n\nThe `event` parameter is a more complex kind of variable (called an \"Object\") that we'll learn more about later. For now just know that for both mouse and keyboard events, the event parameter passes more information about the event. In the case of key events **you can find out the key(s) that were actually pressed by using `event.key`**.\n\n# Do This:\n\n* Drag out an `onEvent` block.\n* Change the ID to `screen1` and the event type to `keypress`.  \n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/537b5bbef3db62c90155528e6753a00a-image-1447175732347.gif\" style=\"width: 450px\">\n\n* Once you hit **Run**, **click on the screen so that the keystrokes will register**.\n* **Type different combinations of keys** and check out the results in the console.

But what if you wanted to do something like **add 10 to the *current* value of a variable**? \n\nBecause updating the value in a variable is just moving memory around, the process has to go something like this:\n* Read the current value of a variable.\n* Add 10 to it.\n* Store the new value back into the same variable.\n\nThe technical term for this is called **variable re-assignment** - when you change the value of a variable based on its current contents.

The terms and concepts used in the unplugged lessons are defined using words that young students can understand.\n\n# TEACHING TIP\nBest practice is to introduce the terms with easy-to-understand language, relate the terms to previous experiences, use the terms repeatedly beyond the lesson itself throughout the entire course (and in other situations) when appropriate, and reinforce students' use in oral and written communication.\n\nThe following terms are introduced in an unplugged lesson as either a Vocabulary word or as a term related to the online Blockly programming interface. Terms are subsequently reinforced in the following online puzzles and activities. Most terms appear multiple times throughout the courses and lessons providing the students with many opportunities to deepen their understanding and assimilate the words into conversations, both in and outside of the classroom.\n\nThe course and lesson numbers after each term indicate the unplugged lessons in which the term is emphasized.\n\n# Look through this list of vocabulary words and then answer the prompt at the bottom of the page. You don't have to learn all the vocabulary words all right now, but you they are here so you can refer back them during this online course. \n\nabstraction\n\nPulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems students.\n\n(Course 3: Lesson 1)\n\nalgorithm\n\nA list of steps to finish a task.

The \"alpha channel\" for color lets you set the level of **opacity** as a decimal value between 0 and 1. It is interpreted as a percentage, so 0.5 equates to 50% opaque.

In the original robotic turtle used 50 years ago, this meant that the pen was down so that it would draw on the paper. The turtle can also move with the pen up, or not tracing its path. The commands to switch between these two are `penUp()` and `penDown()`. The pen by default is set to down position, so to stop drawing with the pen use `penUp()`. When you want to start drawing again, use `penDown()`.\n\n# Do This:\n\n**Read the Documentation:** To figure out how to use `penRGB()` go read the documentation, paying special attention to the syntax used to give a command **multiple values**.\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/3247af8d88da11a042d0bd9a76b49f12-image-1441982501960.png\" style=\"height: 250px; float: left; margin: 10px\">\n\n**Draw the circles: ** \n\nUse `penRGB()`,`penUp()` and `dot()` to draw two overlapping circles as shown in the image.\n\nAll of these new blocks give you new ways to achieve the subgoal `//Set pen properties`. You use this subgoal multiple times to complete this problem as well as the `//Move turtle` subgoal.",
        "SG U3L06 Challenge 6 squiggles_markdown_instruction": "# Multiple Parameters - Making Arcs\n\nMany commands need more than one parameter to make sense. When a command needs more than one parameter, the parameters are separated by commas. **The order of the parameters matters**.\n\nTwo new commands have been added to the block palette, `arcLeft()` and `arcRight()` which both accept two parameters. These two blocks are another way to accomplish the `//Move turtle` subgoal.\n\nRead the documentation for `arcLeft()` and `arcRight()`. Notice that in the documentation you can see what the order of parameters is: first angle, then radius.\n\n\n# Do This:\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/320a5e54abb95b267738d5e15946b51c-image-1441985535028.png\" style=\"height: 250px; float: left; margin: 10px\">\n\n**Draw a squiggly line: ** \n\nUsing `arcLeft` and `arcRight` along with the functions you have already learned to draw a **purple squiggle on a blue background**. Feel free to use any of the methods for choosing colors.\n\n\n\nHints:\n* To make the figure exactly, you need to `//Orient turtle` before calling `arcLeft()` or `arcRight()` by turning the turtle first.\n* The parameters to `arcLeft()` and `arcRight()` are the same.\n* The colors are \"PowderBlue\" and \"Purple\" - though you can use other colors if you like.\n\nThe subgoals for this problem are already in the workspace to help you get started. The first `//Set pen properties` is for drawing the background. Then you will draw the squiggle. Notice that you'll achieve `//Move turtle` using the new arc blocks. As we learn more features of App Lab, you'll have more options for how to complete subgoals. ",

If you want to get the turtle to a specific position on the screen using only `moveForward()` or `turnLeft()`, you need to know the turtle's location beforehand.\n\nTwo new commands in the toolbox help resolve this issue. `moveTo()` moves the turtle to a location on the screen based on its X and Y coordinates. `turnTo()` turns the turtle in a specific direction. Together these commands can make many drawings easier to complete.\n\nJust like `moveForward()`, `moveTo()` achieves the subgoal `//Move turtle`. And just like `turnLeft()`, `turnTo()` achieves the subgoal `//Orient turtle`.\n\n# Do This:\n\n**Read the documentation: ** Read the documentation for `moveTo()` and `turnTo()`.

So |10| is the absolute value of ten and |-10| is the absolute value of negative ten. Both evaluate to 10.\n\nIn Javascript we use `Math.abs` instead of | |.  `Math.abs(-10)` and `Math.abs(10)` both evaluate to <strong>10</strong>.\n</details> <br>\n\n# Do This:\n\n* **Write a function like the one above** that accepts two parameters (one each for `movementX` and `movementY`) and returns a radius. A higher speed should lead to a smaller radius.\n* **Inside your `mousemove` event handler,** set the radius of the circle to the value returned by your function, where the function takes `event.movementX` and `event.movementY` as input.  For example, if using the function above, your code would be: <br>![](https://images.code.org/94a379336084954ba2ab27e80b17dee3-image-1448314255797.30.22 PM.png)\n* Run your program and confirm that **when you draw, the speed of the mouse affects the radius of the dots**.

For example you might say \"keep going down the road until you see the gas station\" or \"keep calling until you get through to someone.\" You might think of these as \"until loops\" rather than \"while loops,\" since we want the loop to continue **until a condition is true rather than while a condition is true**.\n\n**There is no \"until loop\" in JavaScript** but it is actually quite easy to translate \"until loops\" into `while` loops so that you can use them in programs. An \"until loop\" runs *until* a condition is true, as opposed to a while loop which runs *as long as* a condition is true.  That means an until loop is the logical inverse of a while loop - it runs as long as the **condition is false**. The table below shows how you can use the **NOT** ( `!` ) operator to translate stopping conditions into `while` loop conditions.\n\n| Expressed as Stopping | Expressed as Until Loop | Expressed as While Loop |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Stop** once you reach the gas station | Keep going **until** you reach the gas station | Keep going **while** you have **NOT** reached the gas station|\n| **Stop** calling when you get through to someone | Keep calling **until** you get through to someone | Keep calling **while** you have **NOT** gotten through to someone|\n| **Stop** when `x == y` | `until(x == y){...` | `while(!(x == y)){...`|\n<br>\nNote how we can use the **NOT** operation to find the **logical inverse** (or opposite) of the condition from our \"until loop\" to create a `while` loop.

Once your computer sends a request to your database it needs to wait for the response to be sent across the Internet. \n\n**Let's have a look at just how much slower the data commands are**.\n\n\n\n**The array of objects is passed back as the parameter of the callback function for `readRecords`. ** A callback function is required for readRecords just like createRecord as the request out to the database for records will take varying amounts of time and it is necessary to have a way to notify the program once all the records have been collected and return. \n\nRemember that because of scope function **parameters are only accessible inside their function.** Thus we must **use the records from inside the readRecords callback function.**  This is also good programming practice as the asyncronous nature of fetching data from remote locations requires that we **wait for the callback function to be called to know that we have recieved all the information from the data table.**\n\n# Do This\n\n**A set of data has been provided** in a table named 'myTable'\n\n* **Open the Data Viewer** to look at the table in 'myTable'\n* **Add a `readRecords` command** to your app.\n* **Add a `console.log`** inside the callback function of `readRecords` to **print the `records`**\n* Run the program. Notice that the same information from the table is printed in the console.\n\n![](https://images.code.org/fe3db85465b5dd8a983ba5615f4e851d-image-1449504949223.gif)",

For example, if you have many buttons in your program, you will want to give each an ID that describes what the button does. For example \"forwardButton\", \"leftButton\", etc.\n\n**IDs are also case-sensitive** which means you'll want to develop a style for capitalizing IDs. A common strategy is to use a style called **camelcase**.  In camelcase style, words are combined together with no spaces and each new word, after the first, is capitalized. itTypicallyLooksLikeThis.  \n\n**Why?** Many computer systems do not allow keywords like function names and IDs to contain spaces.  You've already seen several examples like this: `moveForward`, `onEvent`, `turnLeft`, etc.  It's important to realize that camelcase is a style convention, not a hard and fast rule. Sometimes you'll see other styles such as using underscores: `move_forward`, `turn_left`.  But in App Lab we typically use camelcase.\n\n# Rules About IDs\nIn making descriptive and meaningful IDs there **are some rules about IDs** you need to know.  IDs...\n* cannot contain spaces.\n* *must* begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) and may be followed by any number of digits and letters.\n* can contain hyphens (\"-\"), underscores (\"_\"), colons (\":\"), or periods (\".\").\n\n# Do This:\nThe code you will begin with has an error. If you run it, you'll see that the ID of the button and the event handler don't match.\n\n* **Improve ** the button ID by choosing a **descriptive and meaningful** ID.\n* **Change ** the event handler so that it correctly references the button by its new ID.\n* **Run ** the program to make sure it works.\n",

It works both with numbers and with variables that contain numbers, as shown below.<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/eb50a1fcea459fe74774d903b07a274f-image-1445887814602.png\" style=\"border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;\"><br>\n\nBecause `num1` is a variable that holds a number, and 10 itself is obviously a number, in this case `+` will do addition like you would expect.\n\n</details>\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>If **either of the operands is a string** `+` treats both as if they were strings and combines them to create a single string.</summary>\nThis is potentially confusing behavior and can get pretty weird if the text *looks* like numbers.  For example, this code will display **16100** to the screen.<br>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/a9c54b664bd192aa5bf611808d88a3bc-image-1445887893598.png\" style=\"border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;\"><br>\n\nWhy? Because JavaScript sees you trying to display a mix of text and variable values. \"16\" (in quotes) is a string of ASCII characters not a number.  And so JavaScript converts everything to text, and the characters in the result of \"16\"+\"100\" comes out to \"16100\". \n\n</details>\n<br>\n \n**TIP:** It's common to want to sandwich a variable between some text when displaying it.  You can string together multiple pieces of text and variables using the `+` operator.  For example, you can do this:\n<br> \n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/65b0e277f058903bd3b956cc59ee5253-image-1445887976271.png\" style=\"border: solid 1px #BBBBBB; height: 30px;\"><br>\n \n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>**Misconception Alert**</summary>\n\nThe **key thing to understand** about the `+` symbol is that it can _only_ do actual arithmetic addition if the values on either side of the `+` are actually numbers or variables that contain numbers. \n\n**And** if the `+` symbol cannot determine whether the value is a number then it **assumes it's a string**, and converts everything to a string and tries to concatenate it.  \n \nThe computer relies on you - the programmer - to make sure that the **type of data** stored in a variable is appropriate for the task at hand.\n</details><br>\n\nOn the next screen we'll have you play with this a little bit, but you'll write statements to display a mix of text and strings from here on out.\n\n# Do This:\nWe have given you the starting code shown below.  You should **modify** the `write` statement on **line 3** to combine text and variables together to make the app display a single line of text as shown.\n\n|starting code|output|\n|--|--|\n|<img src=\"https://images.code.org/a1b84a8728599e9945c576d3bb459140-image-1445891621155.png\" style=\"height:50px\">| <img src=\"https://images.code.org/f5673df128eca0f9637c0cca1729b489-image-1445891800242.png\" style=\"width: 250px\">|",

This single object contains many pieces of information about the event which can be accessed to determine how to respond to the event. For example `event.key` contains the key that was pressed for key events, and `event.offsetX` and `event.offsetY` contain the location of the mouse for mouse events.\n\nBefore we move on to creating objects of our own, let's take another look at this event parameter (or as we'll call it now event object) and recall how they were used.\n\n# Do This\n\n**Starter code** is provided which creates event handlers for both a \"click\" and \"keydown\" event and displays the contents of the event object they create.\n\n* **Run the program** and trigger both a keyboard event and a mouse event.\n* **Examine the objects displayed in the Debug Console** to recall the different pieces of information they contain.\n* **Reflect: ** Why wouldn't we want this information stored in many variables?

Not everyone will see your website the same way you do. Some people might have bad eye sight, others are color blind. How do you design with these differences in mind?\n\nOne of the easiest ways to insure that many people will be able to read the content on your website is to make sure their is enough contrast between the different colors you are using together on your site. Contrast is the state of being strikingly different from something else. Check out the below example of contrasting colors.\n\n| Example 1 | Example 2 |\n| --------- | --------- |\n|<img src=\"https://images.code.org/f4f8acab4c8fe45cddef0436c52084cf-image-1476231852248.jpg\" style=\"width:200px\"> | <img src=\"https://images.code.org/76ea7aba97b7a9717f8b784b0987a055-image-1476231855350.jpg\" style=\"width:200px\"> |\n\nStare at example 1 for a few seconds. You might notice that the edges of the text blur with the background or it feels like the image is pulsing. This is because the value of the colors is too close together. The second is definitely easier to look at because one color is dark and one is light.\n\nA way to test this is convert everything to grayscale. Notice how in the example below the example with contrasting colors is easier to view in grayscale.\n\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/40be05f66945d5cf0fda69be95986a4a-image-1476232151166.jpg\" style=\"width:300px\">\n\nContrast can be a powerful tool to use in your website.

This website uses hex codes for colors. Remember that you can find the hex codes for your colors in your color information from lesson 10.\n* Click the \"See Grayscale\" button to see how well you can read the different text and background colors\n* Consider making changes to your color choices by darkening or lightening up certain colors to make them easier to read.\n\n** Images and examples from http://gomedia.com/zine/tutorials/rule-three-contrast-contrast-contrast/ **",

Over time, they will see that different types of text require different approaches to compression. The lesson ends with an activity where students develop a heuristic, or a rule of thumb, that can be applied to different pieces of text in order to compress them. \n\nThere are three Essential Knowledge Statements and one Exclusion Statement in the Framework dealing with Heuristics: \n\n>- 4.2.1D Some problems can be solved but not in a reasonable time. In these cases, heuristic approaches may be helpful to find solutions in reasonable time. \n- 4.2.2A A heuristic is a technique that may allow us to find an approximate solution when typical methods fail to find an exact solution. \n- 4.2.2B Heuristics may be helpful for finding an approximate solution more quickly when exact methods are too slow. \n- Exclusion Statement (4.2.2B): Specific heuristic solutions are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.\n\nMany people are confused by the difference between *algorithms* and *heuristics*.

A few days after I started, I realized that almost everyone who takes the class isn’t sure if they fit in at first. It's something everyone goes through. Now it seems ironic – everybody feels different at first, when really we're all going through the same thing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 70px; text-align: right; margin-right: 5%; margin-top: -10px; opacity: 0.5\">&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 125%; font-style: italic; margin-right: 70px; margin-top: -20px; \">\nSofia P.

But then we talked in class about things I’m interested in, like music and design, and I realized that I can learn how to do cool new things.

Since the curriculum is based on inquiry learning, lessons feature activities that engage students in discovering core concepts themselves. It’s important to think through implementation plans and student support. In this task you will make a plan for teaching and student support **for one of the lessons in this sequence** that takes into account differentiation strategies and make-up work for absent students. Your teaching and student support plan should cover the following: \n\n\n- **Which lesson in the sequence are you discussing?** \n\n- **Details on how you will implement and differentiate the lesson:**\n\n  - An outline of any changes you will need to make to the lesson to fit your local constraints or context (for example: pacing and time, dealing with classroom setup, etc). \n  - An overview of the types of student needs you’ll likely need to support in your classroom (for example: students who are struggling to understand the underlying concept; students who are already familiar with the concept, but still have room to learn more; etc)\n  - Your plan for addressing each of the needs outlined above (for example: integrating extension activities or other materials for students who already know something about the topic)\n  - How will you address or emphasize the connection between lessons in this sequence? \n\n<br>\n- **Plan for catching up absent students:**\n\n  - How will absent students catch up on activities they missed? \n  - How will you use the fact that the lessons in this sequence are related and build on one another to address make-up work? \n\nYou can type out your teaching and student support plan in the box below, or you can upload a word doc or pdf file. \n\n## Getting Credit for Completing this Task\n\n#### Task Review Details\n\nIf this module is listed as  your “focus area”, then your response to the prompt above will be shared anonymously and reviewed by your peers, and you will review the work done by other teachers. Reviewers will be looking for thoughtful and thorough answers that demonstrate that you have spent time considering how the lesson will play out in your own classroom. Reviewers will have an opportunity to give feedback on your submission, and you can respond to that feedback and resubmit. \n\nIn order to get credit for completing this task, two reviewers need to agree that you have responded to the prompts fully. If reviewers don’t feel comfortable making a decision about your task submission, they can elevate to a facilitator to review. You will always have a chance to address feedback from your reviewers and resubmit your task! Reviewer feedback will show up at the bottom of this page, once it’s available. \n\n<br><br>",

Notice that there is no command to turn right! You need to figure out how to draw this by only turning left and moving forward.  The program should stop with turtle in its original position, facing its original direction.\n\nWhen you're done click the Finish button to move onto the next problem.\n"
